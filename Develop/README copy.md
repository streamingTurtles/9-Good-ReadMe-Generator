  - Once you have entered all your input data, a file will be generated, named your-README.md.  To test that the file has been created, check in the directory from which your ran this app.   You can then simply reName the your-README.md file, typically to README.md and use for your README.  The file generated is named your-README.md to avoid overwritting the README.md for this Repo.  Every time you run the application, the file generated will be overwritten withthe new data you provided.
